To achieve consistent quality ratings across all studies in RBC, every image was manually evaluated by 5 expert raters using Swipes for Science (cite Rokem paper). These ratings allowed us to assign each image a  score of “Pass”, “Borderline”, or “Fail“. In addition to these manual ratings, we provide the Euler number , a measure calculated by FreeSurfer that quantifies the number of surface holes. In prior work, the Euler number has shown to be an accurate, fully-automated measure of data quality; it captures variation in data quality within the coarse categories provided by manual ratings.
